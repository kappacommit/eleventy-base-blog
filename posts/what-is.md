## What is this blog?

**Note**: This blog is primarily focused on development, deployments, application lifecycle management, and just generally the technical side of Salesforce.

I have created this blog to make note of any interesting, niche, or poorly-documented features around Salesforce, and around tools that interact with the Salesforce platform (no proprietary code!)

Examples:
- DevOps with the Salesforce Platform
  - Automated Testing
  - Automated Deployments
- Source Control Patterns
  - Source Control with Large Teams
  - Source Control with Frequent Releases
- Niche Integration Use-Cases
  - External Objects
  - Custom External Data Source Connectors

## Why does this blog exist?

95% of the reason this blog exists is for my own personal documentation of these interesting finds, to serve myself as I move between roles.

If you're reading this, you are the other 5%. I hope it helps you out.

## Who Am I?
- Lead Salesforce Developer at a high-volume Fortune 50 tech company
- Certified Platform Developer 2
- Certified System Architect
