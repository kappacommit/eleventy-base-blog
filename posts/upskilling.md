## Upskilling
This will be a short post. I am covering the value of Upskilling and Knowledge Sharing in the context of software development.

Upskilling is a pillar of DevOps. 
- "**Knowledge silos**" are a risk to all projects. If you have "that guy" on your team who is the only one who knows how to do "that one thing", you have a risk. What if that person wins the lottery and never comes back?
- "**Tribal knowledge**" is similarly a risk to all projects. This is knowledge that is undocumented, and as such, only exists in the minds of the "tribe" (eg: the coworkers who have been there the longest.) 

As such, it is important for teams to knock down these potential risks by ensuring knowledge on a team is both shared and documented when necessary.

Some things we do:
- Every week, we have a 1 hour meeting in which anybody on the team (or even tangent to the team) can share any piece of knowledge that they want. They can demo a piece of new functionality, make note of an issue they are facing or have resolved, or even just bring up a problem they have (even if they don't have a proposed solution.)
- We maintain a **high-level wiki** (in Github) which documents our most important processes. Emphasis on "high-level", because documentation inherently becomes out of date quickly and is rarely updated, it is important that this documentation is written such that it can still remain helpful in the event that certain things change (eg: Don't link to specific lines of code, as those may change.)
  - Some things should not be "high-level." Eg: The process to renew a certificate, or reset a password, should be a very explicitly defined set of steps, and the team should make efforts to keep these updated as needed.
- **Pair programming**. Any sufficiently large project will be worked on by a minimum of 2 people. At the end of the project, you have a minimum of 2 people fully versed in the logic for that work.
