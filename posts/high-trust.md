## High Trust Environments
I debated on whether this should be its own post or an aside in a different post, but decided it is an important enough concept to call out on its own. That is, the idea of a **high trust environment.**

No, this isn't talking about security. Here are a couple characteristics of a high trust environment:

- There is no blame. If an issue occurs (even a serious issue) it is treated as a failure by the team, not as a failure by an individual. 
- No culture of fear. All individuals feel empowered to make *any* change, without fear of being reprimanded if it does wrong. 

## The Value
The value provided by operating in a high trust environment is substantial. 
- If an individual does not feel afraid to admit and own up to their mistakes, they won't feel the need to hide them from the team (or worse: attempt to "fix" them, and in turn make them worse.)
- Open sharing of failures across the team is a form of knowledge transfer. If somebody does X, and it causes a problem, now everybody on the team knows not to do X. (Additionally, the team can implement automated safeguards to prevent X from ever happening.)
- Individuals are more open to make more substantial changes, rather than applying band-aids or attempting not to disrupt the status quo. This can result in signiciant return on value and innovation. 
- In general, people are happier under these conditions.
